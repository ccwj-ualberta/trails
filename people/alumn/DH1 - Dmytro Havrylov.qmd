Dmytro Havrylov was a PhD candidate in Materials Engineering with the CCWJ, joining in September, 2016. Prior to this, Dmytro was a lead engineer in the E.O. Paton Electric Welding Institute in Kiev, Ukraine. Dmytro's research focused on the development of simple formulas that predict the effect of molten metal flows in a weld pool on weld shape and penetration.

Dmytro received University of Alberta Doctoral Recruitment Scholarship (2016) and Captain Thomas Farrell Greenhalgh Memorial Graduate Scholarship (2017). He is a co-author of Sengupta, V., D. Havrylov, and P. F. Mendez. "Physical Phenomena in the Weld Zone of Submerged Arc Welding—A Review." WELDING JOURNAL 98.10 (2019): 283S-313S.
