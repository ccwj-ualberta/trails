Daniele Calista is a PhD Candidate with the CCWJ, where he has been conducting research since 2022. His thesis involves understanding the fundamentals behind the high-frequency electric resistance welding (HF-ERW) of tubular products, including line pipe, casings, and conduit. Through examining how welding parameters influence defect development, Daniele aims to improve the integrity and performance of HF-ERW products. His research supports the application of these materials in demanding conditions, particularly for renewable energy initiatives like hydrogen transport and CO₂ sequestration. Guided by industry partner EVRAZ Inc. North America Canada, the project seeks to optimize manufacturing processes, reduce waste and costs, and enable the reliable production of high-quality welded components.

Beyond academia, Daniele's hobbies include 3D Modelling and printing, and playing and officiating ice hockey, ball hockey, and volleyball. He is also interested in IMSA LMP racecars and racecar engineering.
