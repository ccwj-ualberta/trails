    "text": "Working with Industry\n\nThe CCWJ has a long track record of working with industry. All the projects are industry oriented, and nearly all are funded by industry. Distinguishing traits of the CCWJ are the highly selected students, world-class facilities, ability to use fundamentals concepts to explain observable phenomena, and a culture of collaboration. The Weldco/Industry Chair in Welding and Joining was created in 2007 at the request and with the support of industry. After a worldwide search, Prof. Patricio Mendez came to the University of Alberta in 2009 as the inaugural Chair. The CCWJ Laboratory opened on May 5, 2010 with significant contributions of equipment from Lincoln Electric and Miller Electric. The Alberta Metal Fabrication Innovation program (AMFI) was created on Jan 1, 2011 in partnership between the Canadian Centre for Welding and Joining and Alberta Innovates, with support from Western Economic Diversification and the Government of Alberta.\nAMFI is a unique company development opportunity designed specifically for the Alberta metal manufacturing and fabrication sector. The Program provides innovation and improvement opportunities for sector companies and stakeholders. Participants gain access to both production and business enhancement expertise, developed and provided by some of Alberta’s top research, technology development and process improvement institutions. In 2018, the CCWJ received over $1M from Western Economic Diversification to launch a project in advanced manufacturing system capable of performing automated repairs together with several industry partners, and contributions support from KUKA Canada and Octopuz."

However, the influence of penetrator characteristics, such as size, location, composition, and dispersion, on total CVN energy has not been quantified. Furthermore, the influence of penetrator characteristics on absorbed energy have not been separated into fracture initiation vs fracture propagation components.

    "text": "Laser clad overlays are used in production and repair of components that require improved surface characteristics compared to bulk material properties. The use of powder feed enables cladding with complex multi-component systems that offer superior quality and performance. A potential drawback of powder feed is the reduced material usage efficiency compared to traditional wire fed processes. Maximizing powder catchment efficiency is thus essential to ensuring the sustainability and competitiveness of Canadian laser overlay manufacturing. The limitations of traditional trial-and-error methods necessitate an improved understanding of the relationship between process variables and powder catchment that can be generalized to new material systems. The key technical objectives of this project are:\n\nPerform baseline measurements of laser power distribution, powder cloud distribution and process catchment efficiency.\nDevelop a general model to relate catchment efficiency with process variables through measured features of the laser beam and powder cloud.\nUtilize the model to identify optimized process variables.\nValidate the model with experimental comparisons.\n\nThe methodology employed in this work utilizes state-of-the-art measurement equipment and advanced mathematical modelling techniques.

    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the most promising areas in manufacturing is what is called “advanced manufacturing,” which commonly refers to the new possibilities offered by lasers and additive manufacturing processes. While this technology is well-established in polymers (“3D printing”), applying this technique to metals brings challenges that significantly affect the feasibility on an industrial scale in manufacturing.\nThis project focuses on a specific subset of the area of additive manufacturing, and targets the repair of parts that have been worn out in extreme applications. Such applications include the resource-based industries that experience extreme abrasion in hard-rock mining and oilsands extraction, extreme high-speed wood cutting, and the manufacturing of composites for the aerospace industry, including hot-stages of thrust-vectoring nozzles. The repair welds that take a worn part and bring it back to its original shape have been demonstrated to be very effective, as they can improve the material properties beyond those of the original part, while also reducing the environmental impact.\nTwo main technologies are used in this approach, one involving the deposition of layers (e.g. laser cladding), and another the buildup of 3D structures (e.g. additive manufacturing). However, as each part is unique, the process of making such repairs is currently labour intense, and new processes for 3D scanning and programming the welds are necessary to make the technology economically feasible for more industries.\nThe project will develop novel techniques and processes to scan, program, and weld such parts. The complexities of the project stem from the required combination of part localization, identification and quantification of the damaged part with robust 3D reconstruction and comparison using 3D point-cloud data information, and the tool path planning based on the material behavior. The intrinsic properties of metals during the deposition process results in material transformations and residual stresses throughout the newly deposited material, which require a thorough investigation, and need to be taken into consideration in the toolpath planning. The goal is to create an automated system with Industry 4.0 capabilities that controls the process parameters (laser power, speed, and trajectories) to obtain optimal procedures and properties. Furthermore, the latest generation wear resistant alloys based on Inconel and tungsten carbide technology will be tested and evaluated to further improve material properties. The target industries include manufacturing and the whole range of resource-based industries (e.g. mining, agriculture, forestry, oil & gas).\n\n\n\n Back to top"

As done in previous years, the HQP and beneficiaries from this work will represent the diverse composition of Canadian society.\nMaterials processing, and its application to manufacturing involves people from all walks of life, united by the common thread of a final product. In welding, the fundamental aspects require understanding of heat transfer, fluid flow, electromagnetics, plasmas, metallurgy, and solid mechanics (all are areas in which the PI has an established track record). The HQP involved in this discovery program will master these concepts, and bring them to industry as future employees, as products, or through knowledge transfer.\nThe people closest to the applications are the welders and welding technologists, with a high proportion of indigenous, women, and visible minorities. The PI has hosted welders, welding students, and other interested members of society as part of the previous discovery proposal. During these visits, the HQP learned how to communicate their learning and findings, and the non-academic members of the project learned the “why” behind many of their practical observations. Perhaps most importantly, barriers and prejudices were replaced by appreciation of complimentary approaches to the same end; in this example, welding of real components.\nThe academic aspect of the proposed program will further the significant theoretical and experimental progress made in the previous Discovery grant, which have been published and received prestigious international awards. The methodologies developed will be of direct help in relating processing, structure, and properties to each other at a quantitative level, with an emphasis on welding, but also including other materials processes such as casting, and metalworking (hot or cold forging, rolling, etc.).\nActivities in this program will use deep mathematical concepts and a thorough understanding of physics of materials processes to produce reliable guidelines and heuristics that can be used by practitioners in industry and by other researchers. The education objective of this program is to expose future HQP to real-life processes that are very difficult to idealize, and to teach them to distill the essential features of these processes to make quantitative predictions. Beyond the traditional transmission of knowledge through peer-reviewed publications and the classroom, current efforts will be maintained to disseminate learning using the internet by uploading videos and raw data, and social media. The methodologies to be employed are a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental measurements to generate general design rules from fundamental principles. The PI already counts with all necessary software, experimental facilities, and theoretical foundation to develop and bring to practice the methodologies proposed.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Models of laser cladding have been developed, but they rely on complex numerical methods and computer simulations.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welding engineering lags behind other engineering disciplines in its quantitative predictive abilities, in particular, predictions that can be made quickly by engineers (instead of researchers). The mathematical and physical foundations developed over the last many years allow for the prediction of key magnitudes in welding. Practical predictions are the cornerstone of codes and standards, and expected to have a significant impact in the everyday practice of welding engineers. The predictions presented here have a unique property that consists on being universal and requiring no calibration such as what is needed for a double ellipsoid model or most direct numerical, simulations. The important question in this case is if it is indeed possible to accomplish the simultaneous level of generality and accuracy needed in welding. The expressions to be discussed are validated against a comprehensive literature survey and also against a set of experiments performed with much care to be able to quantify each step. It will be shown how the predictions of thickness of the HAZ are of high accuracy, while the width might be slightly affected by thermocapillary flows. Perhaps most interestingly, the penetration seems to be affected by the arc pressure in a predictable way. This set of comparison of theoretical expressions against a set of real welds is part of a broader program of quantitative tools for welding engineers.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The mode of metal transfer is an important characteristic that is directly related to the current and fall voltages in the welding system. Understanding the interdependencies of these characteristics is important for applications including power source design, and welding output prediction. Traditionally, high-speed videography has been utilized for qualitative and quantitative analysis of metal droplet formation and arc length measurements in GMAW. However, the evaluation of these videos has been limited to human interpretation such as measuring screen captures and still frames, or even taping a ruler to a screen. These evaluations are time-consuming and prone to error. Furthermore, the assessment of critical features such as droplet size, droplet frequency, arc length, and their relationship to voltage and amperage has been limited to evaluating these individual features separately. Thus, posing challenges to comprehensively understand the welding process at large. This work focuses on using a deep learning algorithm (U-Net) to analyze high speed videos of a series of GMAW welds using ER4043 aluminum consumable with parameters to span the globular and projected spray transfer modes. This presentation will discuss performance results of the U-Net algorithm and will showcase the capability to obtain simultaneous quantifiable results of various critical features.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "On-demand part fabrication is of significant interest to the Albertan energy sector, particularly for its applications during shutdowns and maintenance periods. These periods are typically associated with considerable financial losses due to production halts. Unforeseen part failures can exacerbate the situation, extending downtime and increasing costs. The failure of specialty parts is especially detrimental, often leading to prolonged shutdowns due to their limited availability and extended lead times. Without rapid access to these critical components, companies risk further damage, including forced shutdowns and even greater financial repercussions. To mitigate these issues, companies are forced to pay a premium for rapid access to critical components. As the industry seeks effective strategies to address these challenges, on-demand fabrication stands out as a promising approach.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This report presents recent progress in understanding the physics of high frequency electric resistance welding (HF-ERW); in particular, the role of transient ablation which determines the duration a melt is exposed on the welding surfaces. The melt’s exposure to atmosphere typically results in pancake-type oxide inclusions usually called penetrators. Penetrators have been studied in ERW since the late 1970s; however, to date, industry does not have a quantitative model that links process parameters to penetrators. Since ERW is a continuous multi-physical process, understanding each of the occurring mechanisms is crucial to understand which ones contribute to penetrators. Fundamental to ERW is the heat distribution due to the currents imposed on the surfaces. This work presents the analytical derivation and solution of the solid-state temperature distribution in ERW as a single equation. From this analysis, the physical significance of heat penetration compared to the electrical skin depth is treated explicitly. At low temperatures, the skin depth predominates the heat penetration, whereas at higher temperatures the heat penetration predominates the skin depth. As material approaches the weld point, a molten film forms on the surfaces and is immediately expelled from the vee due to electromagnetic forces. The amount of expelled material directly affects the location of the weld point, the actual vee length in the process, and the propensity to form penetrators. The current ERW heat model has been revised to capture the effects of this transient ablation on actual vee length. As heat input increases, melting is induced earlier in the vee, resulting in an actual vee length larger than defined by system geometry. The model has been validated with published mill data from independent sources. Understanding the connection between process parameters and melt exposure is expected to elucidate the connection between process parameters and penetrators.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "The reason behind the higher deposition rate in Mg-containing aluminum alloys in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is explored. Experiments performed on ER1100 (Mg-free alloy) and ER5183 (high Mg alloys) measured current, wire feed speed, and droplet temperature. A non-linear analysis of Joule heating at the electrode extension and an analysis of the power needed to heat the consumable to the droplet temperature were performed. Analysis revealed that Joule heating is two orders of magnitude smaller than what was necessary for the higher wire feed speed. The droplet temperature measurements were done for the first time for both consumables under identical conditions, which revealed that ER5183 had a lower droplet temperature than ER1100 by almost 350 K. The higher deposition rate in Mg-containing alloys is more likely due to the lower droplet temperature than to the increased resistivity of the alloys.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Since ERW is a complex and multi-physical process, understanding each of the occurring mechanisms is crucial to further understand which ones contribute to penetrator defects. At the heart of ERW, and thus penetrators, is the heat distribution with the process’ vee. This overarching thesis work seeks to develop a useful set of equations that model the heat distribution in ERW with a minimum required accuracy over a large range of process parameters. While increasing heat input has been directly correlated to penetrators, the connection between the two is not direct. One significant phenomenon that links heat input to penetrators is the evolution of a narrow gap, or vee length extension, at the process’ weld point. This gap is thought to be a result of intense electromagnetic forces ejecting molten material out of the vee prior to squeezing. The current heat model has been revised to capture the effects of this time-dependent metal ejection in ERW, building upon previous work from Prof. Mendez and Prof. Prisco. While capturing these phenomena, the model has the novel power to predict the exact behaviour of the vee length extension, and thus entire heat distribution, and has been validated with published full-scale mill data from independent sources.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "The work to be presented is the first step in establishing a multi-physical understanding of how entrapped oxides, known as penetrators, form and are retained in ERW seams. Since ERW is a complex process involving the interactions of heat transfer, oxidation, electromagnetic effects, and molten fluid flow, understanding each of these mechanisms is crucial to further understand which ones contribute to penetrator defects. The first stage in this overarching thesis work is the analytical modelling of heat input in ERW. To date, industry and academia have largely focused on numerical simulations and industrial trials of the process; however, we aim to develop a useful set of equations for industry that model the ERW process with a minimum required accuracy over a large range of process parameters. The current model was built on, compared, and contrasted with previous work. A key concept in the model includes the contrast of thermal reference depth versus power reference depth, the larger of which is proposed to indicate whether the process is in a thermal mode or electric mode, respectively. These modes can be related to the estimated power input to the weld, further inferring which process variables are most significant in the given modes. The ability to test this model has been integrated into future experimental design, which requires full scale ERW mill trials and high-speed videography.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This presentation provides a set of simple equations for determining the residual stresses and resulting tendon force in solidified weld metal of surface welds. One of the more significant challenges in welded overlays is how the differential heating and cooling of the overlay and base metal during application can result in significant residual stresses. These stresses can reduce the lifetime of overlays by causing crack initiation and propagation through the overlay or warping in the welded plates. To combat this, much work is done on Low Transition Temperature (LTT) alloys that experience the martensite transition later in cooling. This transition impacts the residual stresses by causing an expansion of the weld metal late into cooling. It has been shown that if sufficient expansion is introduced, compressive stresses can result in the deposited material, significantly improving the performance of the overlay and counteracting plate warping. However, few consistent methods for determining a sufficiently low temperature for the onset of martensite transformation to maximize this effect have been proposed. Through examination of this process, an equation set is presented that can determine the pre-heat and transition temperature required to induce the optimal residual stresses based on this effect. This can allow for the optimization of pre-heating improving throughput and reducing downtime, while providing notable improvement in overlay performance.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "Estimation of Bead Size and Catchment Efficiency in Laser Cladding",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Laser cladding is an overlay deposition technology of applying weld coatings to modify surface characteristics or dimensional build-ups and repair. The geometry of the clad bead in a laser cladding procedure is critical in determining the sequence of passes and its economics. To ensure dimensional accuracy and efficient operation, it is crucial to forecast the size and how much material powders contribute to the clad bead. By providing practitioners with practical expressions for predicting these, the time and expertise required in multiple trials and numerical modeling can be avoided. This presentation discusses mathematical expressions developed based on analytical modeling for predictions using known process parameters and accounting for the distributed nature of the heat source and powder flow. The effective thermo-physical properties of the substrate material for the calculations are determined through computational tools accounting for their variation with temperature. An expression for the thermal efficiency to consider the shadowing effect of the powder cloud is proposed. The empirically obtained results reveal that the fraction falling ahead of the melt pool is negligible, ultimately not contributing to the catchment. An improved analytical estimation of catchment efficiency based on proper integration of mass flow over the surface of the weld pool is introduced, assuming a Gaussian distribution for the laser power and the powder flow with the same distribution parameters. The error of predictions on width and catchment efficiency is within the range of ±10%, except for the cases of the low power and higher travel speed domains. Bead height is overpredicted in every case based on the assumption of a parabolic cross-section of the bead.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

We propose to develop an infrastructure in which the programming of the robot is automated, such that parts can be repaired with a minimum of human intervention.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The proposed research will address practical problems of weldability which are encountered by the industry on a daily basis when determining the feasibility of welding certain alloys, the need for heat treatment, or the potential for cracking. The welding of steel is currently based mostly on an accumulation of empirical knowledge, and quantitative use of fundamental knowledge of phase transformations and processing phenomena is rare. While the current empirical base of knowledge has been helpful with traditional steels, it is unable to provide reliable guidelines for modern steels which have small amounts of alloying elements that affect the microstructure.\nAmong the steels not well understood for welding are fire-resistant steels, seismic steels, high grade microalloyed pipeline steels, and traditional structural steels with microalloying elements accepted in the new revised standards. Current troubleshooting efforts in industry aim at expanding the empirical knowledge base by trial and error, which is a slow, expensive, and wasteful approach when it needs to be repeated across multiple applications.\nThe scientific objective of the proposed work is to predict the properties of a weld such as hardness, strength, residual stresses, or cold cracking susceptibility by using weld parameters accessible in practice such as current, voltage power, travel speed, heat input, and deposition rate. The project approach is simultaneously theoretical and experimental. The theoretical part involves metallurgy and heat and mass transport, and theories of phase transformations, moving heat sources, and mass and energy balances. The experimental part involves metallography and dilatometry, testing of mechanical properties, thermal imaging of welding, and testing of full-scale prototypes. The new knowledge generated will be transferred to Canadian industry as a set of reliable, quantitative guidelines for best practices in the design of weldments for steels with current compositions. Canadian industry will benefit from expanded abilities to deal with new steels, faster development of welding procedures, and a capability to weld with higher quality and higher productivity.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Ni/WC overlays are generally agreed to be the materials with the best cost-performance balance for oil sands extraction and many other mining operations used to benefit from Canada’s abundant resources. These overlays are extremely sensitive to overheating in the molten state, resulting in dissolution of the reinforcement with serious detriment to wear performance. The alternatives to creating these wear resistant deposits is to use a technique called plasma transferred arc welding (PTAW) which involves expensive capital equipment, relatively low productivity, and lack of flexibility for out of position and field repair applications.\nThe proposed investigation aims at exploring a technology of lower capital costs than PTA, with much higher potential for productivity, and with same or better wear performance. The challenge resides in understanding the process conditions, which have never been tackled before. This involves extensive experimentation, heat transfer, fluid flow, and thermodynamic analysis, as well as metallographic and electron microscopy analysis. The impact of this work is high, with the possibility of enabling small and medium enterprises to expand their offer of services and products into a very profitable market.

MSR research and development today continues through the Generation IV International Forum (GIF), in which Terrestrial Energy is the only private sector member company. The ISMR® nuclear power plant is designed for industrial cogeneration, and incorporates a set of proprietary pragmatic design choices that address technical issues and maximize the commercial opportunity for deployment. At its core is a replaceable and sealed “Core-unit”, which restricts volatile fission products and other radioactive particles from escaping to the surrounding containment and will be replaced every 7 years during operation. The presentation discusses ongoing collaborative R&D opportunities that are related to the technology, to manufacturing, and to the materials employed, and was followed by a Q&A session.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

This presentation will cover the steps from qualification to manufacturing based on practical experiences by a leading expert, including the facility certification process, batch qualification, manufacturing process, and special on-time testing.

Percy Page High School, Old Scona Academic High School, Grandview Heights School, Harry Ainlay School, Archbishop MacDonald High School, Ottewell Junior High School, and the WISEST program (since 2016), USchool program (since 2016), and TeamUP (2017).\nThe students learn about arc welding processes and robotics.\nInterns benefit from contacts to industry to get internships in the industry.\nSchools benefit from know-how and technologies that are available at CCWJ.\nFree access to our high-speed videos for teaching.\nAward-winning interdisciplinary projects attract young talent and expose them to welding: CCWJ outreach program has been successful in getting people, and has won a first prize in the AWS poster competition at Fabtech 2015.\n\n\n\n\nA total of 232, 4-month research projects with 168 individual students since 2010.\n33 summer students and 56 international visiting students since 2010.\nIn-depth exposure to welding with a wide range of projects from practical to theoretical through formal classroom teaching and hands-on experience in research.\nPossibility to become co-authors in research publications and CWA Journal articles.\nExposure to international welding research and gaining a solid understanding of current welding technology.\nParticipation in exchange programs and international internships.\nGuest lectures by high-profile international visitors.\nInteract with industry and develop an understanding of industry needs - and get help finding industry internships / co-op placements / jobs.\n\n\n\nMultiple streams of studies: MSc in Welding Engineering, MEng in Welding Engineering, PhD, Post-doctoral research.\nTwo tracks:\n\nLeaders in the practical application of advanced welding processes, metallurgy, and automation.\nLeaders in the creation of new technologies in advanced welding processes, metallurgy, and automation.\n\n\nGain in-depth understanding of welding processes, science, and needs of industry.\nExposure to international welding research.\n\nSolid understanding of current welding technology.\nHands-on welding experience.\nKnowledge: understanding of welding fundamentals.\nResourcefulness: close familiarity with welding industry and practical considerations.\nLeadership: CWA student chapter executive, CWA Edmonton chapter.\nFlexibility: Able to discriminate important from secondary, myths from truth.\nCommunication: Open and clear discussion of ideas with the whole spectrum of welding professionals.\nTeam players: collaboration with international researchers and teamwork in the group.\nExposure: attend trade shows (Fabtech, GPS, etc.) and conferences (e.g. CanWeld, IIW).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCWJ has a strong focus on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusivity\nThe CCWJ is a culturally diverse institution, with up to 13 different nationalities and numerous languages present. We actively and successfully focus on providing an equitable, diverse, and inclusive environment, and support our students in thriving as a lab member, and finding a career in engineering, science, and the welding industry. This support takes place on several levels: on a secondary school level we maintain an outreach program to local high-schools on both the applied (St. Joseph’s High School) and the theoretical side (Old Scona), which exposes students to welding and engineering and encourages them to consider a career in this area. We also participate in the WISEST program and we have hosted four female interns and three female summer students. When the economic downturn in Alberta made it difficult to find employment in welding for one of the female welding apprentices who worked with our lab, we used our contacts to industry and research to ensure she finds welding-related employment that allows her to build her resume, expand her experiences, and join the welding community as a successful professional.\nWe recognize that we are still facing challenges to improve our numbers of female students and indigenous students, and we are making active efforts and seek ongoing feedback on the effectiveness of these efforts. Faculty, staff, and students regularly attend workshops to ensure that the lab environment is inclusive and welcoming to everybody, and regularly engage external resources to adjust our strategies."
