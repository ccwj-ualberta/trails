The Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR®) technology originates from MSR technology
researched, developed, prototyped and demonstrated since the 1950s in a number of national
laboratories. MSR research and development today continues through the Generation IV
International Forum (GIF), in which Terrestrial Energy is the only private sector member
company. The ISMR® nuclear power plant is designed for industrial cogeneration, and
incorporates a set of proprietary pragmatic design choices that address technical issues and
maximize the commercial opportunity for deployment. At its core is a replaceable and sealed
“Core-unit”, which restricts volatile fission products and other radioactive particles from
escaping to the surrounding containment and will be replaced every 7 years during operation.
The presentation discusses ongoing collaborative R&D opportunities that are related to the
technology, to manufacturing, and to the materials employed, and was followed by a Q&A
session.
