Welding on a thin plate with surface heat losses is used as a case study, and the results obtained are validated against published data for many materials, processes, and researchers.},

	abstract = {The problem of moving heat sources is central to a wide range of fields including welding, heat treatment, tribology, grinding, machining, and manufacturing of microfluidic channels. This problem has been approached numerically and analytically but the solutions are often difficult to apply in engineering practice.

Numerical solutions are often difficult to implement for practitioners without specialized software or not versed in computational modelling. The solutions published are valid for the particular values of parameters considered in each publication, and it was been difficult to generalize the results to a large number of practical cases with different parameters. Analytical solutions are also diffi cult for practitioners to implement because they often involve series summations that typically have inconvenient expressions for addressing practical questions. For example, the question of “what is the weld width" is difficult to answer, even as a rough approximation, using the simplest of models, the one proposed by Rosenthal and Rykalyn independently. Textbooks often omit a treatment of moving heat sources, or introduce the foundations for mathematical or numerical analysis, but do not present practical expressions amenable to use by practitioners.

This presentation will introduce current work using a modern methodology to obtain useful engineering expressions for identifying moving heat source features of interest to practitioners, such as isotherm width, cooling rate and melting efficiency. The methodology is based on the concepts of characteristic values like isotherm width and cooling rate, dimensional analysis, asymptotic analysis, and blending techniques. A specific example of how to calculate such characteristic values with the equations directly simplified from analytical solutions will also be presented.},

	abstract = {The effects of several variables on pitting fatigue life of carburized steels were analyzed using a geared roller test machine (GRTM). The material variables that were primarily used to influence retained austenite include aim surface carbon concentration (0.8 \% and 0.95 \%), alloy (SAE 4320 and a modified SAE 4122), and cold treatment (performed on one material condition per alloy). Testing variables included contact stress in addition to a variation in lambda ratio (oil film thickness/surface roughness), arising from variation in roughness among the machined surfaces. Test results are presented, and differences in performance are considered in terms of material and testing variables. A primary observation from these results is an improvement in contact fatigue resistance apparently arising from cold-treatment and the associated reduction of retained austenite at the surface.},
