Provide a link to the video - for youtube use the direct link (this is also best because the thumbnail for the video is also generated automatically by using the https://img.youtube.com/vi/<my-video-id>/hqdefault.jpg) format in the header):

{{< video https://youtu.be/ePulkz8F-zs >}}

Or for a video stored in a Google Drive location, place this code chunk in the document (but update the URL). Google drive does not automatically create a video thumbmail, so you will also have to create your own screenshot of the video and save it into the seminars or conferences directory.
