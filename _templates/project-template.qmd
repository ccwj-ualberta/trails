Put your description of the project here.

The default categories match those in the 'Research themes' [Physics of Welding, Metallurgy, Welding Automation, Numerical Modelling]. You are free to remove any. New categories can also be added by simply including another/new element in the list, which will automatically be added to the filter/table of contents in the projects page.

Each project needs to have a sponsor logo image. Logos for a number of granting organizations are already present in the `research/projects/granting-logos` directory. You can also add a new logo in this directory and then link to it by updating the `image: granting-logos/my-new-logo.png` field in the header.
