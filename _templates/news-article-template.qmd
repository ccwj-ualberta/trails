Add your text here (and place completed document in the `/news/news-articles` folder).

The news article is free-form, i.e., you might consider including bullets:

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

Or you might want to include a numbered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

You can also include additional images in the article, for example:

Or if the image is contained in the same "news" directory:
