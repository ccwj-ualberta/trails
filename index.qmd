**The Canadian Centre for Welding and Joining** (CCWJ) at the University of Alberta (UofA) is a world-class research and training facility employing researchers at all stages of their career and awarding doctoral degrees through the [Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering at the University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/engineering/chemical-materials-engineering/index.html).

Our mission is to advance interdisciplinary research and share comprehensive expertise in welding, joining, metallurgy, and joining process development. Our research activities focus on everything from fundamentals to applied research, and cover virtually all welding and joining processes in a broad range of material systems.

## From Science to Industry

The centre addresses the needs of manufacturing, construction, and natural resources sectors in Alberta and Canada. We offer innovation and improvement opportunities for the Alberta metal manufacturing and fabrication sector through programs like the Alberta Metal Fabrication Innovation program (AMFI). Our work is organized around four core pillars:

## Research

::: {layout="[ 60, 28 ]"}
:::: {#first-column}
The CCWJ is recognized globally for its cutting-edge research in welding and joining technologies. Over the past decade, our funding support exceeds \$6M.

Our research has historically been centred on steel applications and product development, wear protective overlays, numerical modelling of welding, and laser-based advanced manufacturing. Our results in this area have been published in leading journals including [Acta Materialia](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2018.03.050), and [Materials Transactions A](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11661-014-2603-8).

Our current research themes include:

- **Welding Processes:** Research on all arc welding processes, resistance spot welding, and laser welding.

- **Material Systems:** Focus on steel applications, wear protective overlays, and laser-based advanced manufacturing.

- **Friction Stir Welding:** Progress towards predictive models and understanding defect formation in this solid-state welding process.

- **Numerical Modelling:** Development of models to predict welding features such as cooling rates, heat-affected zone (HAZ) width, and residual stresses.

- **Automation and AI:** Application of artificial intelligence to quantify metal transfer from high-speed videos and other automation initiatives.
