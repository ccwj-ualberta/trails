TRANSWELD software, developed by Transvalor, is used for predicting the thermomechanical behavior of assemblies during welding processes. It integrates multi-physical models to simulate the real behavior of metal in liquid, mushy, and solid states, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of material evolution.
