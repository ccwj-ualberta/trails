Welding software used to model and optimize a variety of thermal joining processes, taking into account the orientation. It can predict phase transformations in the heat-affected zone, thus helps understand the weld structure in the HAZ. Simufact Welding succeeds in realistically predicting the distortions and residual stresses that occur during welding.
