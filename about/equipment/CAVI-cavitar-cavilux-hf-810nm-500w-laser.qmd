The CAVILUX HF is a versatile and powerful pulsed diode laser light source designed for high-speed illumination in scientific and industrial applications. It operates at either 640 nm (visible) or 810 nm (invisible), with an output power of up to 500 W coupled to a 1.5 mm diameter fiber. The laser offers precise illumination, camera synchronization, and compatibility with high-speed cameras.
