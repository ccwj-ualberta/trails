Semiautomatic machine used for routine grinding and polishing. With this machine it is possible to obtain a perfectly smooth, deformation free surface, which is required to observe the true microstructure. The microstructure observation is necessary for analysis, both qualitative and quantitative, and is usually a quality assurance for industry.
